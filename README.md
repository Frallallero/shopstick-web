# **Shopstick**

## Description

I am building an application by using Springboot web services (RESTful API) &amp;
HTML (Thymeleaf) to act as a simple e-commerce shop used by both Customer &amp; Shop
Owner. I have used **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA** with **H2 database**, for views i have used **Thymeleaf** template engine and **Bootstrap** CSS framework. Moreover I included  **Springfox** to generate the swagger to document the APIs endpoints.
